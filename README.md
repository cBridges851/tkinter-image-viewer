This is my second project I have made while learning Tkinter. It is an application that allows you to view images that are in the images folder by the Python file.

## Motivation
In freeCodeCamp's Tkinter course (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXPyB4XeYLA&t=2331s), I had learnt about using icons, images and making exit buttons. I didn't make an exit button for this application, but I found it straightforward anyway, but I did practise putting images onto the application and changing the icon of the window.

## Tech/Framework
[Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) - a standard library in Python to make applications with GUIs.

## Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Installation
- Clone the project via your terminal: `https://github.com/cBridges851/tkinter-image-viewer.git`
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/cBridges851/tkinter-image-viewer.git

    cd tkinter-image-viewer
    ```
- Make sure you have the Pillow and Tkinter package installed.      
    - You can manually install them through [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) by executing the following commands simultaneously.
        `````sh
        pip install tk
        pip install Pillow
        `````
        OR

    - Use the [requirements.txt](https://learnpython.com/blog/python-requirements-file/) file present in the repo to install them.
        `````sh
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        `````


- In your terminal, execute `python image-viewer.py` to run the application.
    ```sh
    python run.py
    ```

## How To Use
- To view images:
    - When the application has opened as per above, you should see an interface that looks like this:
    ![Image Viewer Interface](Image_Viewer/image-viewer.png)
    - To navigate through the pictures, either click on the arrow buttons on the sides, or press the arrow keys on your keyboard.
- To change the images in the viewer:
    - Navigate to the images folder in the project's directory in the file explorer, and add or remove images!
